Allows you to easily embed pre-populated tweets within links in your blog posts/pages.

== Description ==

I have found that the number of times a blog post is tweeted can be improved by more than 25% by embedding pre-populated tweets into links in your posts.

Easy Tweet Embed allows you to easily add such links to your blog posts/pages, which can lead to more shares, more traffic, and more subscribers.

Just click the Easy Tweet Embed button in your Visual Editor, add the anchor text you would like to display in your post/page, and the tweet that you would like to embed, then click "Embed Tweet". Easy Tweet Embed takes care of the rest!

1. Upload "easy-tweet-embed.php" to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory
